/**
 * RolesGuard — reserved for FUTURE system-level role checks.
 *
 * NOT currently used in this application.
 *
 * Our RBAC is fully project-scoped — meaning a user's role (OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER)
 * only exists within the context of a specific project, stored in ProjectMember.
 * This project-scoped check is handled by project-access.helper.ts instead.
 *
 * This guard would be useful if we add system-wide roles in the future,
 * for example a global "SUPER_ADMIN" role for a platform admin dashboard.
 *
 * Usage (when needed):
 *   @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
 *   @Roles('SUPER_ADMIN')
 *   @Get('admin/dashboard')
 *   getAdminDashboard() {}
 */
/**
 * RolesGuard enforces Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
 *
 * Important: RolesGuard must ALWAYS run AFTER JwtAuthGuard,
 * because it depends on request.user being populated by the JWT strategy.
 *
 * How it works:
 *  1. A route is decorated with @Roles(Role.OWNER, Role.ADMIN)
 *  2. RolesGuard reads those required roles from the route metadata
 *  3. It checks if the current user's role in the project satisfies the requirement
 *  4. If not, it throws a 403 Forbidden
 *
 * NOTE: For project-scoped roles (OWNER/ADMIN/MEMBER), the service layer
 * handles role checks using the ProjectMember record — this guard handles
 * simpler route-level role requirements.
